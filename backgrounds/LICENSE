Official Debian GNU/Linux wallpapers comes from https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktop/Artwork
Official Ubuntu wallpapers comes from other users uploading them (therefore not considered official?)
wallpapers in "Unsplash" folder uses the Unsplash license (duh)
if I can't find the license to the wallpaper then just use MIT or similar
